Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome
, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x):

        str_x = str(x)

       
        return str_x == str_x[::-1]


sol = Solution()

x1 = 121
print(sol.isPalindrome(x1))  

x2 = -121
print(sol.isPalindrome(x2))  

x3 = 10
print(sol.isPalindrome(x3))
